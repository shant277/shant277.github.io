        <pre> Hello,

            I am Shant Sharma, an aspiring developer working to create the best projects I can 
            with the best technology has to offer while ensuring it is accessable to as many people
            as possible.

            I recently graduated from Grant Macewan University with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Computer 
            Science with a focus on Systems and Information Security. 
            
            I seek to acquire more experience and knowledge by working in the industry while better improving myself
            and my skills in an effort to deliver the best projects I can develop.
